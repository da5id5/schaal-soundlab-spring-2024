# schaal eurorack sound example

## Built a patch with the Audio Frequency Lab eurorack.  

patch performance starts with waveform tone that is released into melodic line.  Over time the melodic line devolves into a bass line that is intermidatlely interupted by a lower tone than the one at the beginning

1. used both oscillators from DPO to generate a complex waveform that could be tweeked to produce both a melody and grinding bass line.
2. outputs to mixer as seperate ins to control level of each oscillator
3. used Pamela's Workout as a clock to drive a sequence in Rene
